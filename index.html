        title: "How Do Phones and Social Media Affect Childhood?",
        date: "October 10th, 2024",
        content: `
            <p>I believe that growing up with phones and social media is terrible for the children that experience it and disappointing to those viewing it, and for good reason.</p>
                <img src="IMG1.jpg" alt="Kids on phones, not talking to each other">
                <p>I remember vividly the desire to own a phone at a young age. However, looking back on it, owning a phone throughout my childhood did nothing but restrict it in a lot of ways, mainly socially. I find myself frequently envisioning what an uncomfortable or awkward social setting would be like without a phone, and what I see is a solution. I see the people awkwardly talk, I see them being forced to feel that pressure, that feeling of “I Hate every second of this,” and I believe being forced through that, you find ways to make it better in the future. However, I feel that now, if you don’t know what to say to someone, as soon as you feel that awkwardness creep in, you can instantly and effectively alleviate yourself from that situation. There is no reason to develop social skills if you can find a way to escape that awkwardness much easier. Another piece of evidence to support that phones have an impact on social skills is looking at previous generations, generations that grew up without the means to effortlessly have something to pay attention to. You can notice that these generations have less social anxiety.</p>
                <img src="IMG2.jpg" alt="Person on phone with kids socializing behind them">
                <p>The topic of social media will also never fail to come to mind. The issue with social media is that you constantly see it with your phone. But what are you actually seeing? You are seeing only the amazing parts of a horrible life. In the form of a young, rich, usually attractive and popular person. However, these celebrities are quite blind when it comes to their influence. They don’t understand that not only will people want to be them and want the things they have, but they will actively try to be them and do the things they do because they define success to the youth. They don’t understand that we are going to compare ourselves to them, as they are successful to us. But it’s ridiculous to compare yourself to the most beautiful people on the planet or the most talented, leading to the thought “I suck.” This thought may plague every inch of your thought causing serious mental health problems.</p>
                <img src="IMG3.jpg" alt="Split image of a rich person and a normal person">
                <p>Another huge issue with phones is that it leads to a dopamine addiction. Just like every addiction, phones will give your brain a nice shot of dopamine whenever you see something funny, or an attractive person, or really anything that would make you happy. However, every mainstream company and corporation strives to give you nothing but what you want, more dopamine. So they create AI and algorithms to deliver as much of it to you as possible, leaving you feeling less happy when not consuming content. This blends nicely with the fact that you have poor social skills and have trouble talking to people, causing a need to escape the real world.</p>
                <p>An annoying problem with them also is you’re able to do so many amazing things with your phone; you have access to the internet, and along with it, everything that it entails: educational videos on nearly everything you could possibly be curious about, highly sophisticated cameras, advanced scientific calculators, video games, and everything else. It’s an incredible tool and it has so many amazing things about it. I feel that if I asked somebody why phones are great, the last thing they would think of is how they actually use their phone, and that's a huge issue in the fact that you associate it in the first place with an amazing thing.</p>
                <p>Overall I think that phones greatly negatively affect the lives of the youth today and will lead to a horrible fate for humanity. As a society, we begin to look at the issue of technology and its effect on the youth, because if we don’t, I feel that we are leading ourselves into a horrible fate.</p>

        content: `
            <p>In this post, I want to tackle the thought on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will change the future of science. To answer this question, it’s important to first understand what science and AI really are.</p>
        <p>Science is the systematic study of the natural and physical world, built on observations, predictions, experiments, and testing. It’s split into two broad categories: natural science (like physics, biology, and chemistry) and behavioral science (like psychology, sociology, and economics).</p>
        <img src="IMG(2)1.jpg" alt="Diagram of the scientific model" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
        <p>Now let’s look at AI. Right now, AI is most effective in areas like language processing—where it can predict outcomes or analyze complex variables based on existing data. However, when it comes to more advanced scientific problems, AI has its limits. It can’t think creatively or solve problems in innovative ways like humans can. That means, for AI to truly revolutionize science, it will need to evolve.</p>
        <img src="IMG(2)2.jpg" alt="AI thinking outside of the box" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
        <p>Will AI ever be able to think "outside the box"? As of now, it’s great at processing vast amounts of information but can’t generate truly original ideas, the way it works is purely off input. As throughout most of history, great scientific discoveries tend to come from looking at something differently and having a different interpretation of data than everybody else. If AI ever gains the ability to think creatively, it could potentially solve some of the biggest scientific challenges, like finding a cure for cancer, climate change, and unraveling the mysteries of the universe. But that remains to be unseen.</p>
        <p>Personally, I believe that unless AI learns to be more creative, it won’t be able to outthink the human mind when it comes to complex, unsolved problems. Humans have the ability to imagine and create new solutions, the ability to look at something and see what it's made of, what it is, but most importantly what it can be, something that AI still lacks. However, if AI evolves to think creatively, it could completely transform the way we solve scientific problems.</p>

            <p>In this post, I want to share my reflections on a recent class activity that focused on connecting with my classmates. This exercise was successfully aimed towards growing our social skills and giving ourselves a greater perspective, as it encouraged us to learn more about each other.</p>
        <p>During our Composition class, we participated in a question-and-answer session where we asked various classmates different questions. I had the chance to connect with 22 people, and it was a rewarding experience. Through these conversations, I learned about a variety of interests and backgrounds. For instance, Beatrice is an exchange student from Italy who speaks multiple languages. Kaitlyn enjoys baking depending on her mood, while Ivan, also here on exchange from Germany, plays an instrument. Ashley has traveled to the U.S., and Amelia is an avid reader. Kai is an artist who shares his music on SoundCloud, Roby is dedicated to the volleyball team, and Jack has the unique hobby of swimming in the ocean during winter.</p>
        <p>Our teacher, Mr. Bambrough, has also been open about his own interests. He loves travel and literature, holds a degree in creative writing, and even leads the Ballenas Cinema Club.</p>
        <p>Overall, this activity displayed the diversity in our classroom and helped us to connect with one another allowing further connection to be achieved if desired. It’s important to appreciate our differences while also finding common ground, and actively practice doing so as social media’s effects on our generation's social skills are tremendous.</p>

             <p>My name is Sheldon Redford, I am a 16-year-old high school student, and this is my first post. I really wanted this post to be a reflection of my way of thinking while answering a question that has an opinion-based answer.</p>
        <p><strong>Is it harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past?</strong></p>
        <p>I believe that growing up now is much harder in the 21st century as opposed to previous centuries. Now there are many more issues and problems to face. An example of this is bullying. Now you can bully people completely anonymously and nobody will ever know it’s you. Along with this, it’s more socially acceptable (borderline desirable) to be a bully or partake in it. Another huge topic to discuss is the price of living and how much this increase affects your plans and behavior. With the cost of basic needs such as a vehicle, gasoline, rent, food, post-secondary education, being so high, this can completely alter and restrict a person's aspirations and potential. Another thing to pair with this is also an overlaying expectation of an increase in performance compared to the last generation/previous century. Like I previously said, it's more difficult to attain basic needs; however, this pairs perfectly with an increased expectation of achievements and functionality, as it's harder to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>What role does stress play in your life?</strong></p>
        <p>I believe the role stress plays is a fluctuating role in my life. Stress will cycle between dictating my life and then also providing no influence. I feel that stress is a very controlling and restricting thing to experience, and I personally find it interesting when exploring the causes of it. For me, I can experience stress throughout many day-to-day activities, such as social interactions, schoolwork, family relationships, the well-being of others, and responsibilities. Though along with my interest in its causes, I’m also interested in the effects of stress. I personally can observe stress to be a restricting feeling, as it limits your ability to think critically while maintaining clarity of thought; it often distracts you from what matters most. Along with this, stress also limits your confidence, as long as you’re stressing about anything to do with yourself or your well-being, as you’re more susceptible to overthinking and taking things too seriously. Overall, I believe stress can have a severe effect on one's ability to think critically and their ability to work and solve problems.</p>
